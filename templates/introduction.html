        <h2>G1Bbon benchmark</h2>
        <p>
            The G1Bbon benchmark is based on a Temporal Reasoning Task, designed to test temporal integration and decision-making capabilities across human players and language models. 
            The ultimate goal is to drive the development of the best probabilistic reasoning LLM constrained to <strong>1.5 billion parameters</strong>, setting a new standard for temporal reasoning and pattern detection.

        <h2>What is the Temporal Reasoning Task?</h2>
        <p>
            The Temporal Reasoning Task is a cognitive experiment designed to test how well participants can detect patterns
            that emerge over time and to integrate information across multiple rounds to make accurate decisions. It challenges both human players and language models to identify statistical biases in color distributions across different spatial locations.

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>In each game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each round presents multiple buttons that reveal a color when clicked.</li>
            <li>One quadrant has a statistical bias, showing a specific color more frequently.</li>
            <li>Your goal is to determine which quadrant contains the bias.</li>
            <li>The color bias becomes noticeable only after several rounds.</li>
        </ul>

            Try the task yourself and see how well you can detect temporal patterns.
